 3330. Find the Original Typed String I
 Easy
 Topics
 Companies
 Hint
 Alice is attempting to type a specific string on her computer. However, she tends to be clumsy and may press a key for too long, resulting in a character being typed multiple times.

 Although Alice tried to focus on her typing, she is aware that she may still have done this at most once.

 You are given a string word, which represents the final output displayed on Alice's screen.

 Return the total number of possible original strings that Alice might have intended to type.



 Example 1:

 Input: word = "abbcccc"

 Output: 5

 Explanation:

 The possible strings are: "abbcccc", "abbccc", "abbcc", "abbc", and "abcccc".

 Example 2:

 Input: word = "abcd"

 Output: 1

 Explanation:

 The only possible string is "abcd".

 Example 3:

 Input: word = "aaaa"

 Output: 4



 Constraints:

 1 <= word.length <= 100
 word consists only of lowercase English letters.
